        "product_description": "Pro JYM provides a protein shake that is superior to the majority of whey protein concentrate powders available as it contains whey protein isolate and micellar casein in equal measures. You receive the benefits of four different protein sources- whey protein isolate, micellar casein, milk protein isolate and egg albumen. There is a generous 24g of protein per serving in Pro JYM. This facilitates your muscle protein synthesis rate to reach new levels and allows you to build greater muscle mass than a regular protein powder in your quest to build that muscular physique. Consuming this over products with a single protein source also allows your body to also prevent catabolism- overturning the process of your body feeding on its muscles as an energy source and allowing you to hold onto those muscle gains you have worked so hard for.",

A whopping 25 grams of protein per scoop. And it tastes great. We endeavored to create the ideal bodybuilding protein source, one worthy of the thirty-plus year Animal legacy, and the accolades garnered in the trenches assure us that this enterprise was a success. Never ones to settle, however, we continue to push for excellence.",
